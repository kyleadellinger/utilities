# PACKER block:
# contains Packer settings, including version
# required plugins are also here
# each plugin block contains a 'version' and a 'source' attribute
# 'source' is only necessary when using a plugin outside of hashi

# SOURCE block:
# configures a specific 'builder' plugin, which is invoked by BUILD block
# uses 'builders' and 'communicators' to define:
#       - virtualization to use
#       - how to launch image being provisioned
#       - how to connect to it
# builders and communicators bundled together and configured in SOURCE block
# SOURCE can be reused across multiple builds
# multiple SOURCEs can be used in a single build
# two important labels:
#       - builder type
#       - name
# in example, 'builder' type is 'docker', 'name' is 'ubuntu'
# each 'builder' has own attributes

# BUILD block:
# defines what Packer should do with artifact after it launches
# in example, 'build' block references image defined by SOURCE block

# packer initialize
# packer init $dir
# initializing will download plugins. will exit without output if already present.

# format
# packer fmt $file

# validate
# packer validate $file

# build ex:
# packer build docker-ubuntu.pkr.hcl
